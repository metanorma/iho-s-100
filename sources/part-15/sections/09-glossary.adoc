.S-100 Data Protection Scheme terms
[cols="a,a"]
|===
| AES | Advanced Encryption Standard, encryption algorithm used in the scheme
| Data Permit | File containing encrypted product keys required to decrypt the licensed products. It is created specifically for a particular user
| Data Client | Term used to represent an information consumer receiving the encrypted information. The Data Client will be using a software application (for example ECDIS) to perform many of the operations detailed within the scheme.
| Data Server | Term used to represent an organization producing encrypted data files or issuing Dataset Permits to end-users
| M_ID | The unique identifier assigned by the SA to each manufacture. Data Servers use this to identify which M_KEY to use when decrypting the Userpermit
| M_KEY | System manufacturer's unique identification key provided by the Scheme Administrator to the OEM. It is used by OEMs to encrypt the HW_ID when creating a userpermit
| HW_ID | The identifier assigned by an OEM to each implementation of their system. This value is encrypted using the OEM's unique M_KEY and supplied to the data client as a userpermit. This method allows data clients to purchase licences to decrypt datasets
| PKCS | Public Key Cryptography Standards
| IV | Initialization Vector used by the AES-CBC encryption algorithm
| SA | Scheme Administrator. IHO is responsible for maintaining and coordinating all operational aspects and documentation of the Protection Scheme
| SHA | Secure Hash Algorithm
| SSK | Self Signed Key (Self Signed Certificate File)
| User Permit | Encrypted form of HW-ID uniquely identifying the Data Client system
