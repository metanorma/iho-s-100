== Scope

S-100 part 15, later referred to as 'the Data Protection Scheme' or 'Protection
Scheme', describes the recommended standard for the protection of hydrographic or
spatial information based on the IHO S-100 Universal Hydrographic Data Model. It
defines security constructs and operating procedures that must be followed to
ensure that the Protection Scheme is operated correctly and to provide
specifications that allow participants to build compliant systems and distribute
data in a secure and commercially viable manner.
