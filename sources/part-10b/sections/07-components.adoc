== Components and relationships to standards

The GML data encoding for S-100 consists of the following components, realized as separate XML schemas:

. An XML schema that defines a GML profile ("*Profile"*). This is a restricted subset of
types and elements ("XML constructs") defined in the GML 3.2.1 schemas. XML constructs not
needed for S-100 data products are excluded.
. An XML schema defining additional XML constructs ("*S100base"*). This schema uses the
GML profile schema. The constructs defined in this schema are expected to be needed in
order for a product specification conforming to the S-100 standard to define a format for
datasets.

<<fig-10b-1>> below illustrates the relationships between the various elements of the
S-100 framework, an S-100 product specification and the GML profile. The GML encoding
standard (<<ISO19136>>) provides an implementation schema (XML Schema) for the
ISO 19100 conceptual schemas. The S-100 GML profile is a subset of the constructs
defined by the GML implementation schema. S-100 common elements are defined in a common
elements XML schema conforming to the profile. GML formats for specific data products use
the constructs in the common elements to define XML types and elements corresponding
strictly to feature and information types defined by the relevant Product Specification in
the Feature Catalogue. A dataset is an XML file conforming to the GML Application Schema.

=== Use of profile

The typical use of the profile is to define a format for GML files encapsulating datasets
packaged as files.

Formats for modes of exchange other than datasets are not required to use these Schemas.

The S-100 GML Profile has been defined to support Schema validation. The S-100 GML Profile
must be declared within the Application Schema. This allows a validation engine to select
this Schema instead of the GML 3.2.1 Schema to validate the data against.

A GML Application Schema mirrors the feature/attribute names, multiplicities, geometric
primitives, types and relationships which are defined in the Feature Catalogue. While
Schema validation is possible it should also be possible to unambiguously parse a GML
dataset using the Feature Catalogue without recourse to the Application Schema.
