== Divergences from common GML practices

The GML profile (<<cls-10b-8>>) and base schema (<<cls-10b-11>>) diverge from common GML
practice in the following items:

. Interpretation of missing curve interpolation value (see <<cls-10b-10.1.2>>).
. Geometry properties are defined individually instead of using substitution groups.
There is no single property which functions as a spatial attribute in all features.
