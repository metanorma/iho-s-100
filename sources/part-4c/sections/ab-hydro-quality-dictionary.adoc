== Hydrographic Quality Metadata profile Data Dictionary

The hydrographic metadata Catalogue table below has been derived from the ISO 19115
Standard.

The table contains the following information:

. The first column "__ISO LineNo.__" refers to the line numbers in the ISO 19115
Standard, however as this profile does not use all the 19115 elements, line numbers may
not always be contiguous.
. Name/role name is a label assigned to a metadata entity or to a metadata element.
Further columns could give the name or meaning in other languages.
. Definition column provides a description of the metadata entity/element.
. The obligation descriptor provides an indication of whether a metadata entity or
metadata element shall always be documented or will only sometimes be documented. This
descriptor may have the following values: M (mandatory), C (conditional), or O
(optional).
. The Occurrence column specifies the maximum number of instances the metadata entity
or the metadata element may have. Single occurrences are shown by "1"; repeating
occurrences are represented by "N". Fixed number occurrences other than one are
allowed, and will be represented by the corresponding number (that is "2", "3"...etc.).
. Data type specifies a set of distinct values for representing the metadata elements;
for example, integer, real, string, DateTime, and Boolean. The data type attribute is
also used to define metadata entities, stereotypes, and metadata associations.
. Domain - for an entity, the domain indicates the line numbers covered by that entity.
