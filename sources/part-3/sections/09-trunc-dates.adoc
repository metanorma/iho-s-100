== Use of format-specific types for truncated dates

Data formats may utilise specific types as supported by that format in order to
incorporate truncated values. Where this occurs the format description must
specify the mapping between the S100_TruncatedDateAttributeType values and those
of the format-specific types.

[example]
====
An XML based encoding may use the _gMonthDay_ simple attribute type (which is an
XML Schema built-in type) as an equivalent representation for "December 17 each
year":

xs:gMonthDay: `--12-17`

This is equivalent to the value `----1217` in a data format which adheres strictly
to S-100.
