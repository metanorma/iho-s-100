== Context

=== Objects

The data content of a geographic application is defined in accordance with a view
of real world features and in the context of the requirements of a particular
application. The content is structured in terms of objects. This document considers
two types of object:

. Features -- features are defined together with their properties.
. Information Types -- information types are used to share information among
features and other information types. Information types have only thematic
attribute properties.

The GFM provides a conceptual model for these objects. The definitions for object
types are held in a Feature Catalogue. The GFM also acts as a conceptual model for
the Feature Catalogue.

=== Derivation of the General Feature Model

A conceptual model of types that shall be used in S-100 products is presented in
this document. It is known as the GFM and is derived from the ISO 19109 General
Feature Model by realization of its classes (<<fig-3-1>>).
