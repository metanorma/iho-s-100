== Scope

Users of S-100-based data products are likely to receive and use different
S-100-based data products simultaneously and those data products are likely
to contain features which may have some common elements or be different
expressions of similar underlying concepts. Other data layers such as radar
overlays may also be present. The smooth interoperation and harmonized,
user-friendly graphical presentations of these various products is
necessary. This Part defines a framework for creating rules for the
interoperation of S-100 data products, including harmonized graphical
presentations and handling of alarms and indications.

This framework can be used to establish system specific rules which are
contained in an Interoperability Catalogue, a type of meta-product that
describes how groups of products are to be used and displayed
simultaneously.
