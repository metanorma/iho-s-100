== Correspondence to and suppression of Portrayal Catalogue elements

Correspondences between Interoperability Catalogue and Portrayal Catalogue
elements are summarized in <<tab-16-19>> below. In all cases, the
supersession of Portrayal Catalogue display by Interoperability Catalogue
display applies only to the subset of features remaining after applying
the filter described by the attributes geometryType and
attributeCombination.

[[ex1]]
[example]
A Portrayal Catalogue for an overlay product places all its features in
the same display plane, but the Interoperability Catalogue splits them
into over-radar and under-radar planes.

[[ex2]]
[example]
Feature *Current -- Non-Gravitational* is allowed to have point, curve, or
surface geometry. It is possible for a Portrayal Catalogue to place them
in different viewing groups depending on the type of spatial primitive and
for an Interoperability Catalogue to override that placement and put all
instances of this feature, whether point, curve, or surface, in the same
viewing group.

[[ex3]]
[example]
The area boundary symbolization is changed from a simple to a composite
line style for area boundaries common to different types of area features,
for example an anchorage area in product A bordering a marine protected
area in product B.
