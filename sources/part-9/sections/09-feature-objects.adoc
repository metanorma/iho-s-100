== Feature objects

Feature objects are abstractions of real world phenomena. This Schema
defines the abstract base type for any feature type. The type Feature is
derived from Object and adds a sequence of spatial relations and a geometric
primitive attribute to the properties from the base class, as well as
optional associations to other features.

When an association is present, the code of an feature association defined
in the Feature Catalogue should be used as the element name in place of
_associatedFeature_ - see <<app-9-A>> for more information.
