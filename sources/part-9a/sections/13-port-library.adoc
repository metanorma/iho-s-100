== The Portrayal Library

There is no change to the organization structure of the portrayal library as defined
in <<Part9,clause="9-13.2">>. The "Rules" folder XSLT contents of <<Part9,clause="9-13.2">> are
replaced with Lua script files. __FileType:rules__ described in
<<Part9,clause="9-13.3.32">> is used to identify each of the Lua script files.
