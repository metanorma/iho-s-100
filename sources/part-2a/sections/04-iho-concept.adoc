== IHO Concept and Data Dictionary Registers

=== Detail of registered items

[[cls-2a-4.1.1]]
==== IHO Concept Register

The following are the details available in a Concept Register to describe and
manage hydrographic, marine-related and meta data information:

. Item Name
. Item Identifier
. Item Status
. Alias
. Camel Case
. Definition
. Definition Source
. Definition Reference
. Similarity to Source
. Remarks
. Proposal Type
. Successor
. Predecessor
. Submitting Organization
. Date Proposed
. Date Accepted
. Date Amended
. Proposed Change
. Justification

These details are derived from the classes S100_RE_RegisterItem and
S100_RE_ManagementInfo (see <<cls-2a-4.2>> below and Part 2, clauses 2-8.3 and
2-8.8).

[[cls-2a-4.1.2]]
==== IHO Data Dictionary Register

The following are types of items, as derived from a Concept Register, which may be
registered within a Data Dictionary Register:

. Feature -- abstraction of real world phenomena.
. Attribute -- characteristic of a feature concept.
. Enumerated Value -- one of a set of mutually exclusive values constituting the
domain of an attribute.
. Information -- an identifiable object that contains attributes, associations to
other information concepts, but no spatial information.
. Codelist -- an open enumeration, or the identifier of a vocabulary (mapping
between codes, labels and definitions).

==== S100_RE_Register

The class S100_RE_Register models a Register in a Registry. Further details can be
found in S-100 Part 2, clause 2-8.2.

==== S100_CD_RegisterItem

The class S100_CD_RegisterItem is a specialization of the class
S100_RE_RegisterItem and carries the characteristics that are common to all types
of registered items listed in <<cls-2a-4.1.1>>. This class is included in the model
for consistency with Part 2b, in which a similar extension (S100_PR_RegisterItem)
defines additional attributes.

==== S100_CD_Attribute

Attributes may either be simple or complex. A simple attribute carries a specific
value such as a date. A complex attribute is an aggregation of other attributes
either simple or complex. Examples of complex attributes are in <<app-2a-A>>. This
class is derived from S100_RE_RegisterItem via intermediate super-classes and
describes the common characteristics of all attribute types.

If the _valueType_ is S100_Codelist exactly one of the following must be true:

. There is an associated S100_RE_Reference with the namespace of a dictionary that
is listed in the IHO GI Registry.
. There is at least one S100_CD_EnumeratedValue associated to the attribute.

Condition 1 identifies the dictionary for codelists of type "open dictionary" or
"closed dictionary". Condition 2 provides the enumerated value(s) for codelists of
type "open enumeration". The precise codelist type is determined in individual
Product Specifications.
