== Implementation guidance

The HDF5 C API includes interfaces for determining the types of compound
type components. This suggests that the size of a datatype can be checked
to mitigate possible conversion issues.

The HDF5 C API also defines iterators for iterating over attributes or
items in a group. These iterators can be used to discover profile
datasets, groups, or attributes from datasets, groups, and attributes
defined only in individual Product Specifications (the product-specific
items will have names different from the profile items).

The order in which objects are retrieved may not be the same as the
creation order. Implementers should allow for this or investigate the
availability of order-preserving functions in the HDF5 API.

Linkage between the XML feature catalogue and objects in the HDF5 file is
preserved by using the (camel case) codes for features, and attributes.
