== Application Schema Realizations from <<Part8>> (Informative)

<<fig-10c-13>> below illustrates the realization of different types of
coverages as described in <<cls-10c-10.1>> and <<tab-10c-4>> from the
coverage types defined in <<Part8>>. Product Specification development teams
may wish to develop similar figures for their Product Specifications to
describe how the coverage types as encoded in the HDF5 format for their
data products are realized from the coverage types defined in <<Part8>>.

It is possible to extend <<fig-10c-13>> to include upper-level derivations
from ISO types, at the potential expense of a more crowded figure.
<<fig-10c-14>> illustrates the idea for the Regular Grid coverage type.
Note that the hypothetical Application Schema allows both discrete grid
point coverage and continuous grid coverage types; if only continuous grid
coverage is needed the CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage and
CV_DiscreteCoverage classes can be omitted. Also, since this hypothetical
Application Schema uses only regular grids, the coordinates of grid points
can be calculated from the grid origin and cell size, and the
CV_GeometryPair class associated to S100_IF_Grid is not needed and has
been omitted from <<fig-10c-14>>.
