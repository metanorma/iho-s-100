== Scope

The Hierachical Data Format 5 (HDF5) HDF has been developed by the HDFgroup
as a file format for the transfer of data that is used for imagery and
gridded data. This Part is a profile of HDF5 and specifies an interchange
format to facilitate the moving of files containing data records between
computer systems. It defines a specific structure which can be used to
transmit files containing data types and data structures conforming to the
S-100 General Feature Model.

This Part specifies constraints and conventions that collectively specify
the rules for S-100 HDF5 data formats. HDF5 features not required by S-100
HDF5 data are excluded. The scope of this Part is limited to the data
format and does not include the application schema, nor does it include
guidelines for how to develop Product Specifications or naming rules for
features and attributes.
