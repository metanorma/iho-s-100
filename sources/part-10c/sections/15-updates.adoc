== Updates

Updates to HDF5 datafiles are recommended to follow the same structure as
the base HDF5 datafile. Updates may include only the HDF5 datasets which
are being updated. The specific datasets being updated are included in
their entirety in the update datafile.

This clause implies that S-100 datasets may be updated in part as well as
replaced completely by updated data, but Product Specifications are not
required to permit partial updates. They may define update creation and
management processes which are more suitable for their particular domains
and applications. However, if updates to parts of S-100 datasets are
allowed, the rule in the previous paragraph must be followed.
