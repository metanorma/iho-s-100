== Support files

The HDF5 format does not encode support file information as feature
attributes; that is, application schema thematic attributes cannot be
references to support files. This means that references to pictures or
text files, etc, are not permitted in coverage features.

Also, feature and information associations from coverage to vector
features are not permitted.

The HDF5 "metadata" attribute of the root group is a reference to an
external metadata file. The reference must be a string of the form:

`fileRef:<fileName>`

where `<fileName>` is the base name of the <<ISO8211>> or GML file.The
extension part of the file name is not used.

Mixed vector-coverage data products may continue to use support files in
connection with vector feature classes and define vector feature or
information classes with attributes that are references to support files,
as usual.
