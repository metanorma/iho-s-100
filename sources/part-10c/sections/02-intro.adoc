== Introduction

HDF5 uses an open source format. It allows users such as the IHO to
collaborate with The HDF Group regarding functionality requirements and
permits users' experience and knowledge to be incorporated into the HDF
product when appropriate.

HDF5 is particularly good at dealing with data where complexity and
scalability are important. Data of virtually any type or size can be stored
in HDF5, including complex data structures and data types. HDF5 is
portable, running on most operating systems and machines. HDF5 is scalable
- it works well in high end computing environments, and can accommodate
data objects of almost any size or multiplicity. It also can store large
amounts of data efficiently - it has built-in compression. HDF5 is widely
used in government, academia, and industry.
