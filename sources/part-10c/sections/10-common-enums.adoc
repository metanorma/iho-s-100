| 48
| -

| Value
| hydrographicZero
| A vertical reference near the lowest astronomical tide (LAT), below which the sea level falls only very exceptionally
| 49
| Deviation between LAT and hydrographic zero may be due to a strong anticyclonic atmospheric condition, adding weight to the water column that may exceptionally cause the lowest sea level to fall below the astronomical low water level

NOTE: The numeric codes are the codes specified in the IHO GI Registry for
the equivalent listed values of the IHO Hydro domain attribute _Vertical
Datum,_ since the Registry does not at present (20 June 2018) contain
entries for Exchange Set metadata and dataset metadata attributes.

Datums not included in the S-100 enumeration must be encoded using the
"other: ..." form. If the datum in question is listed in the IHO GI
Registry (as one of the standard listed values for attribute _Vertical
Datum_ in the IHO Hydro domain), the "camel case code" in the Registry
must be used in the "other: ..." element. For datums from the EPSG
Registry but not listed in the IHO GI Registry, the form should be "other:
EPSG_NNNN".

[example]
"Local Low Water Reference Level" is in the IHO GI Registry but not listed
in the S-100 standard. It must be encoded with the camel case in the GI
registry as: "other: localLowWaterReferenceLevel".

[example]
"European Vertical Reference Frame 2019 mean tide" is in the EPSG Registry
list of vertical datums (EPSG 1287) but not in the IHO GI Registry list.
It must be encoded as: "other: EPSG_1287".

If the datum is not listed in any the table above, the IHO GI Registry, or
the EPSG Registry, producers should determine a suitable special code in
consultation with the IHO Working Group(s) and the IHO GI Registry
authority.

The use of datums that are neither in the enumeration above, nor in the
IHO GI Registry, nor the EPSG Registry is discouraged. Producers who need
to use a datum not listed in the S-100 enumeration should propose its
addition to the IHO GI Registry and/or this enumeration by means of an
S-100 maintenance proposal.

*Note that application software is not required to process information
encoded in "other: ..." form, meaning that ECDIS software, for example, is
not required to recognise any datum encoded as "other: ..." and will
therefore be unable to adjust ENC depth information with water level data
from the corresponding <<S104>> dataset, and may warn or reject the <<S104>>
dataset as being incompatible with <<S101>> ENCs.*
