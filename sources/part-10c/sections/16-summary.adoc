== Summary of model

The basic structure of the HDF5 profile (<<fig-10c-7>>) can now be
presented as a more detailed conceptual model using the group and dataset
specifications in the previous sections. The conceptual model of HDF5 file
contents is shown in <<fig-10c-12>>. This Figure shows the group structure
and the datasets which contain spatial representations and data values.
(Metadata attributes and datasets containing metadata are not included for
the sake of simplicity.) The _MatchingOrders_ association indicates that
the sequences of elements in the associated datasets are interdependent.
