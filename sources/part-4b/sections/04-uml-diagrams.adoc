== UML diagrams and data dictionary

The metadata Schemas for the imagery and gridded data are included in
<<ISO19115-2,annex=A>> in the form of UML class diagrams. These diagrams
augment the UML diagrams shown in <<ISO19115-1>>.

<<ISO19115-2,annex=B>> contains the element and entity definitions for
the metadata Schemas defined in <<AnnexA>>. The dictionary, in conjunction
with the diagrams presented in <<AnnexA>> and in combination with the UML
diagrams and data dictionary presented in <<ISO19115-1>>, serves to fully
define the total abstract model for metadata.

Enumerations and their values provided in <<ISO19115-1>> are normative.
User extensions to enumerations shall follow the rules as described in
<<ISO19115-1>> and <<Part4a,annex="E">>.
