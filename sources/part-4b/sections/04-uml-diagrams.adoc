== UML diagrams and data dictionary

The metadata Schemas for the imagery and gridded data are included in
<<ISO19115-2,annex=A>> in the form of UML class diagrams. These diagrams
augment the UML diagrams shown in <<ISO19115-1>>.

<<ISO19115-2,annex=B>> contains the element and entity definitions for
the metadata Schemas defined in Annex A. The dictionary, in conjunction
with the diagrams presented in Annex A and in combination with the UML
diagrams and data dictionary presented in ISO 19115-1, serves to fully
define the total abstract model for metadata.

Enumerations and their values provided in <<ISO19115-1>> are normative.
User extensions to enumerations shall follow the rules as described in
<<ISO19115-1>> and Annex 4a-E of S-100.
