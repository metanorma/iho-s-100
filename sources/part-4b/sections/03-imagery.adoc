== Imagery and gridded data metadata

<<ISO19115-1>> identifies the metadata required to describe digital
geographic data, and the extensions described in this section identify
the metadata required to describe digital geospatial imagery and gridded
data. Digital geospatial imagery and gridded metadata may also be
provided for aggregations of datasets.

=== Associated ISO standards

<<ISO19115-1>> is designed to be the general metadata standard applicable
to all geographic data sets. It identifies a set of core metadata
derived from the many metadata elements and also specifies the
conditions under which they should be used (that is mandatory,
conditional, or optional). Although there is some service metadata in
<<ISO19115-1>>, (particularly in the area of identification), much of the
service metadata is defined in <<ISO19119-16>> (Services). <<ISO19115>> makes
provision for limited metadata describing spatial and temporal Schemas.

<<ISO19115-2>> extends the metadata defined in <<ISO19115>> and identifies
additional metadata (such as data quality, spatial representation,
content, and acquisition information), required to describe imagery and
gridded data. It provides information about the properties of the
measuring equipment used to acquire data, geometry of the measuring
processes employed by the equipment, and production processes used to
digitize the raw data.

Geolocation information is a very important metadata component required
for imagery. <<ISO19115-1;and!ISO19115-2>> may not include sufficient
geolocation metadata for imagery and gridded data. It may therefore be
necessary to reference <<ISO19130>>. This standard specifies additional
information required to support geolocation and also defines how sensor
measurements and geolocation information are logically associated. The
georeferencing information in <<ISO19130>> is a subset of that described in
<<ISO19115-2>>. In order to develop a full set of imagery metadata, it may
be necessary to combine the relevant sections from <<ISO19115-1>> and
<<ISO19115-2>>, with the geolocation information or sensor properties from
<<ISO19130>>.

<<ISO19115-3>> - XML Schema implementation for fundamental concepts,
expands <<ISO19115-1;and!ISO19115-2>> by defining new constraint types that
further refine the metadata elements for implementation. It also defines
the rules used for deriving an XML Schema from the ISO abstract UML
models.

=== Metadata packages

The relationships between the packages contained in <<ISO19115-1>> and the
extensions for geospatial imagery and gridded data are illustrated in
<<fig-4b-1>> below. Dependencies on other packages are also shown in the
figure. <<ISO19115-2>> packages are shown with no fill, <<ISO19115-1>>
packages with grey fill, and the others (<<ISO19107>> (Geometry), <<ISO19157>>
(Data quality) and <<ISO19103>> (Conceptual Schema language)) in other
colours. These metadata extensions have been fully documented using both
UML models and a data dictionary, in <<ISO19115-2,annex=A;and!ISO19115-2,annex=B>> respectively.

It should also be noted that, to ensure global uniqueness, <<ISO19103>>
requires that all class names must be defined by a bi-alpha prefix that
identifies the package to which a class belongs. The <<ISO19115>> series
uses the prefixes MD (Metadata), CI (Citation), DQ (Data quality), EX
(Extent), and LI (Lineage). To differentiate between classes used in
<<ISO19115-1>> and those used in <<ISO19115-2>> (Extensions for imagery and
gridded data), the MI prefix is used for imagery and gridded metadata,
and LE and QE are used for extended Lineage and Data quality classes
respectively. (Data quality classes are now defined in <<ISO19157>>.)
<<tab-4b-1>> contains the list of package identifiers for the classes
used for metadata.

==== Metadata Entity Set for Imagery

MI_Metadata is a subclass of MD_Metadata which aggregates the optional
entity MI_AcquisitionInformation. See <<ISO19115-2,clause="A.2.1">> and
<<ISO19115-2,clause="B.2.1">> for additional descriptive information and
the data dictionary respectively.

==== Data quality information for Imagery

Information about the sources and production processes used in producing
an imagery or gridded dataset has been included in an additional Data
Quality for Imagery package, as <<ISO19115-1>> only makes provision for a
general assessment of the quality. The following additional classes are
listed below. A more detailed description of the classes and associated
data dictionary are provided in <<ISO19115-2,clause="A.2.2">> and
<<ISO19115-2,clause="B.2.2">> respectively, and <<ISO19157>>.

. QE_CoverageResult is a specified subclass of DQ_Result and aggregates
information required to report data quality for a coverage. It is based
on concepts from <<ISO19115;and!ISO19139>>.
. QE_Usability is a specified subclass of DQ_Element. It is intended to
provide user specific.
. Quality information about a dataset's suitability for a particular
application.
. LE_ProcessStep is a specified subclass of LI_ProcessStep and contains
additional information on the history of the algorithms used and
processing performed to produce the data. LE_ProcessStep aggregates the
following entities:
.. LE_Processing, describes the procedure (such as software used,
parameters, and processing documentation) by which the algorithm was
applied to generate the data from the source data. LE_Processing
aggregates LE_Algorithm, which describes the methodology used to derive
the data from the source data;
.. LE_ProcessStepReport identifies external information describing the
processing of the data;
.. LE_Source is a specified subclass of LI_Source and describes the
output of a process step.

==== Spatial representation information for Imagery

This package contains information concerning the mechanisms used to
represent spatial information. This package defines the following
entities:

. MI_Georectified contains check point information to further specify
georectification details of the imagery or gridded data. It aggregates
MI_GCP;
. MI_Georeferenceable makes provision for the inclusion of additional
information that can be used to geolocate the data. It aggregates
MI_GeolocationInformation.

==== Content information for Imagery

Although this package is part of <<ISO19115-1>>, the following entities
have been included to better cater for imagery and gridded data:

. MI_Band (subclass of MD_Band) - defines additional attributes for
specifying properties of individual wavelength bands in an imagery and
gridded dataset;
. MI_ImageDescription (subclass of MD_ImageDescription) - used to
aggregate MI_RangeElementDescription;
. MI_CoverageDescription (subclass of MD_CoverageDescription) - used to
aggregate MI_RangeElementDescription;
. MI_RangeElementDescription - used to provide range elements used in a
coverage dataset.

==== Acquisition Information for Imagery

MI_AcquisitionInformation is an aggregate of the following entities:

. MI_Instrument (the measuring instruments used to acquire the data);
. MI_Operation,(the overall data gathering program to which the data
contribute);
. MI_Platform (the platform from which the data were taken);
. MI_Objective (the characteristics and geometry of the intended object
to be observed);
. MI_Requirement (the user requirements used to derive the acquisition
plan);
. MI_Plan (the acquisition plan that was implemented to acquire the
data).

Two additional classes are required to provide information on the
acquisition of the data. These are:

. MI_Event describes a significant event that occurred during data
acquisition. An event can be associated with an operation, objective, or
platform pass; and
. MI_PlatformPass identifies a particular pass made by the platform
during data acquisition. A platform pass is used to provide supporting
identifying information for an event and for data acquisition of a
particular objective.
