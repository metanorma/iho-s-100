[[cls-12-1]]
== Scope

As users begin to implement S-100 and associated Product Specifications, errors
and deficiencies in S-100 may be found and these will need to be handled in a
uniform manner. This Part specifies procedures to be followed in updating,
maintaining and publishing the various parts of S-100. It excludes the
maintenance of the IHO Geospatial Information (GI) Registry, as each Register
Manager will have their own specific procedures for updating their Register(s).
Additionally, this Part excludes the maintenance regime of Product
Specifications. However, S-100 versions must be backward compatible to ensure
interoperability of Product Specifications.

NOTE: All S-100 based Product Specifications shall include a maintenance
section.
