  note: In older versions of this standard, curly brackets '{' and '}' have been used in the format control section of the Data Descriptive Field. Though this does not conform to the <<ISO8211>> standard, implementers should be aware that curly brackets may appear. They should not be considered or treated as an error. They should be interpreted as if they were round brackets '(' and ')'.
