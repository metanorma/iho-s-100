- table-name: "Knots"
  intro: Knots are parameters used in spline curves to control the shape of the curve. Each knot defines a value in parameter space of the spline, which will be used to define the spline basis functions. The knot data type holds information on knot multiplicity. The parameter values in the knot array must be monotonic and strictly increasing; that is, each value must be greater than its predecessor.

- table-name: "Derivatives"
  intro: |
    The derivatives field encodes the derivatives of a curve at a point. Any missing values must be encoded as 'omitted' values (see <<cls-10a-4.5>>). Derivatives are encoded in order beginning with the first-order derivative.

    The derivatives are given in terms of their X and Y components. In this edition of S-100 derivatives are defined only in 2-D because splines are only in 2-D.

    The derivatives are defined in floating-point and integer formats to be used with the corresponding types of coordinate fields.
