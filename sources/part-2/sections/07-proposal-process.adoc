=== Approval process

The process for determining the acceptability of proposals is illustrated in
<<fig-2-1;and!fig-2-2>> above. It must be completed within a time period specified
by the Register Owner, in accordance with <<S99>>.

The Register Manager shall ensure the following:

. If the proposal is for clarification or retirement of a Register item, set the
_itemStatus_ of the item to 'processing'; and forward the proposal to the Register
Domain Control Body; or
. If the proposal is for registration of a new item or supersession of an existing
Register item:

.. Assign an _itemIdentifier_ to the new or superseding item;
.. Set the _itemStatus_ of the item to 'processing', and
.. forward the proposal to the Register Domain Control Body.

The Register Domain Control Body shall:

. Decide to accept the proposal without change; to accept the proposal subject to
changes negotiated with the Submitting Organization; or not to accept the proposal.
Criteria for not accepting a proposal include:

.. The specification of the item is incomplete or incomprehensible;
.. An identical or very similar item already exists in the Register or in another
Register of the Registry;
.. The proposed item does not belong to an item class included in the Register;
.. The proposed item does not fall within the scope of this Register; or
.. The justification for the proposal is inadequate.
. Inform the Register Manager of the decision, and the rationale for the decision,
within a time limit specified by the Register Owner, in accordance with <<S99>>.

The Register Manager shall:

. Serve as the point of contact if there is a need for negotiations between the
Submitting Organization and the Register Domain Control Body regarding changes to
the proposal that are specified by the Domain Control Body as a condition of
acceptance; and
. Inform the Submitting Organization representative of the results of processing
the proposal.

If the decision of the Register Domain Control Body is positive, the Register
Manager shall, in accordance with policies for the Register:

. Complete the proposal management record with _proposalStatus_ set to 'accepted';
and _dateAmended_ to the date of the Domain Control Body's decision;
. Make approved changes to the content of the Register item; and
. Set the Register item _itemStatus_ to 'valid'. For supersession or retirement
proposals, the replaced or retired item has __itemStatus__ set to 'superseded' or
'retired', as appropriate.

If the decision of the Register Domain Control Body is negative, the Register
Manager shall:

. Update the proposal management record by setting _proposalStatus_ to 'rejected';
and _dateAmended_ to the date of the Domain Control Body's decision; and
. Inform the Submitting Organization of the deadline for appealing the decision of
the Domain Control Body.

Submitting Organization representatives shall:

. Negotiate with the Register Domain Control Body through the Register Manager,
with regard to changes to their proposal that are specified by the Domain Control
Body as a condition of acceptance; and
. Make known within their respective Submitting Organization communities or
organizations the decisions taken on proposals by the Domain Control Body as
transmitted to them by the Register Manager.

The Register Manager shall:

. Disseminate the results of the approval process to the public.

==== Withdrawal of proposals

Submitting Organization representatives may decide to withdraw a proposal at any
time during the approval process.

The Register Manager shall:

. Change the proposal management record _proposalStatus_ from 'not yet determined'
to 'withdrawn'.

==== Appeals

A Submitting Organization representative may appeal to the Register Executive
Control Body if it disagrees with the decision of a Register Domain Control Body to
reject a proposal for addition, clarification, supersession or retirement of an
item in the Register. An appeal shall contain at a minimum a description of the
situation; a justification for the appeal; and a statement of the impact if the
appeal is not successful. The appeal process is included in the overall proposal
process as shown in <<fig-2-1;and!fig-2-2>> above.

The Submitting Organization shall:

. Determine if the decision regarding a proposal for registration is acceptable; and
. If not, submit an appeal to the Register Manager.

The Register Manager shall:

. Forward the appeal to the Register Executive Control Body.

The Register Executive Control Body shall:

. Process the appeal in conformance with its established procedures;
. Decide whether to accept or reject the appeal; and
. Return the result to the Register Manager.

The Register Manager shall:

. Update the proposal management record fields _proposalStatus_ and __dateAmended__;
. Update the Register item __itemStatus__; and
. Provide the results of the decision to the Register Domain Control Body and to
the Submitting Organization representative.

The Submitting Organization representative shall:

. Make the results of the appeal known within their Submitting Organization
community or organization.

=== List of Submitting Organizations

The Register Manager shall maintain and publish a Register-specific list of all
qualified Submitting Organizations that may submit proposals for changes to the
content of each Register that it manages. Each list shall include the name and
contact information of the representative(s) for each Submitting Organization. The
Registry shall contain an application to become a Submitting Organization. The
Register Owner will be responsible for accepting or rejecting the application.

=== Publication

The Registry Manager shall ensure that information about valid, clarified,
superseded, or retired items in the Register is readily available to users. The
method for providing this information may depend upon the requirements of the
members of the user community.

=== Integrity

The Register Manager shall ensure that, for each Register being managed:

. All aspects of the registration process are handled in accordance with good
business practice;
. The content of the Register is accurate; and
. Only authorised persons can make changes to the Register content.

The Registry Manager shall ensure the security and integrity of the Registry using
IT best practices.
