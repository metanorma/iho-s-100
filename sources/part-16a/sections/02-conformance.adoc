== Conformance

This Part is not a profile of an ISO or other standard. Instead, it is based
on -- and, where possible, conforms to -- specifications for the portrayal
of Electronic Nautical Charts (ENCs) and general principles for ergonomics
and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Much of this document is derived from
the <<S52>>, especially <<S52,clause=2>>, <<S52,clause=3>> and
<<S52,clause=4>>.

This Part is based on specifications that evolved from studies and
discussions by IHO, IMO, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),
and manufacturers. These efforts resulted in a set of related standards and
specifications promulgated by IHO, IMO, and IEC, which are cited in the
references section of this Part and summarised in <<cls-16a-4.1>>. The
general principles for ergonomics and human-computer interaction (HCI) have
been described in various HCI and ergonomics publications.
