== Scope

This Part specifies the principles for harmonising portrayal and other
presentational functionalities across different S-100 based data products
for the purpose of improving the user experience and reducing ambiguities
within systems utilising multiple S-100 based data products. It also
describes the relevant International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidance
and resources within International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) that
support efforts in portrayal harmonisation. It does not address the
portrayal process, functionality, or architecture, which are addressed in
other S-100 Parts (especially 9 and 9A), but instead focuses on
presentational design aspects, such as display organisation, colours, and
symbology.
