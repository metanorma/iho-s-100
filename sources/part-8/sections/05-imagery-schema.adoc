=== Coverages

[[cls-8-5.1.1]]
==== General overview of coverages

A coverage associates positions within a bounded space to attribute values. A coverage
is a subtype of feature; that is, it associates positions within a bounded space to
the attribute values of the feature. A continuous coverage function associates a value
to every position within the spatial temporal domain of the function. A discrete
coverage function is only valid at specific positions within the domain. Geometric
objects within the spatiotemporal domain drive the coverage function. A coverage
function effectively acts as an interpolation function for the geometric objects
within the spatiotemporal domain, which establishes a value within the range of the
function for every position within the domain.

The geometric objects within the spatiotemporal domain are described in terms of
direct positions. The geometric objects may exhaustively partition the spatiotemporal
domain, and thereby form a tessellation such as a grid or a TIN. Point sets and other
sets of non-continuous geometric objects do not form tessellations.

<<ISO19107>> defines a number of geometric objects (subtypes of the UML class
GM_Object) to be used for the description of features. Some of these geometric objects
can be used to define spatiotemporal domains for coverages. <<ISO19123>> defines
additional subtypes of GM_Object that are specialised for the description of
spatiotemporal domains. In addition, <<ISO19108>> defines TM_GeometricPrimitives that
may also be used to define spatiotemporal domains of coverages.

The range of a coverage is a set of feature attribute values. The value set is
represented as a collection of records with a common Schema. For example, a value set
might consist of temperature and depth measured at a given time over a bounded area of
ocean. A coverage function may be used to evaluate a depth and temperature anywhere
within the bounded area.

The concept of coverages is described in this document to relate coverage functions to
the set of geometric objects and the direct positions that drive the coverage
functions. It is through the concept of coverages that one may relate the concept of
features to a grid, a set of TIN triangles or a point set. This description has been
adapted from <<ISO19123>>. S-100 only addresses grids, TINs and point sets.

[[cls-8-5.1.2]]
==== Discrete coverages

A discrete coverage has a spatiotemporal domain that consists of a finite collection
of geometric objects and the direct positions contained in those geometric objects. A
discrete coverage maps each geometric object to a single record of feature attribute
values. A discrete coverage is thus a discrete or step function as opposed to a
continuous coverage. For example assigning a feature code to each cell in a grid cell
tessellation is a discrete coverage. Each grid cell is either associated or not
associated with a particular feature. Point set coverages in hydrodynamic data, such
as observations from distributed sensors, are also frequently discrete coverages in
that the data values at any single point in the point set apply only in the vicinity
of the point.

[[cls-8.5.1.3]]
==== Continuous coverages

A continuous coverage has a spatiotemporal domain that consists of a set of direct
positions in a coordinate space. A continuous coverage maps direct positions to value
records. In principle, a continuous coverage could consist of no more than a spatially
bounded, but transfinite set of direct positions, and a mathematical function that
relates direct position to feature attribute value.

[[cls-8-5.2]]
=== Point sets, grids and TINs

S-100 addresses only imagery and gridded data associated with grids, TINs and point
sets. These constructs establish the basic geometry elements used in this component of
S-100.

[[cls-8-5.2.1]]
==== Point sets

A point set is a set of GM_Point objects in a bounded area. These point objects might
each be associated with one or more features. They may also be used to form a coverage
and serve to drive a coverage function. Hydrographic soundings may be considered as a
point set. For each point set value it is necessary to know the position of the point
as well as any associated attribute value and associated feature reference. Attributes
may be assigned to an entire point set as an aggregate as well as to individual
points. This is common practice for hydrographic soundings where metadata may be
associated with a sounding object that consists of a point set of individual
soundings. Several point sets may be aggregated into one coverage. A simple point set
with associated metadata is illustrated in <<fig-8-5>>.

[[fig-8-5]]
.Point Set with associated metadata
image::img59.png[]

A Point Set is a set of 1, 2, 3 or stem:[n] dimensional points in space. A Point Set
Coverage is a coverage function associated with point value pairs in 2 dimensions.
That is, a coverage function is driven by a set of points (with stem:[X], stem:[Y]
position) together with a record of one or more values at that position.

[[cls-8-5.2.2]]
==== Grid types

A grid is a regular tessellation of a bounded space where two or more sets of curves
in which the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets in a
systematic way. The curves are called grid lines; the points at which they intersect
are grid points, and the interstices between the grid lines are grid cells. A grid
covers the entire bounded space. Grids form the basic geometry for a gridded data
coverage. There are several different regular tessellations of a space that are all
subtypes of the general concept of grid. Common to all grids is an implicit sequence
or traversal order. There also exist a number of possible traversal orders for grids,
some more useful than others in different situations. The location of a grid cell is
defined implicitly by the regular grid organization and the traversal order. For
example, in a rectangular grid each grid cell can be addressed by the row and column
order of the grid. It is therefore not necessary to maintain the direct position of
each grid cell. More complex grids require more complex traversal orders, however
regularity still permits the position within the grid to be determined from the grid
structure and the traversal order. The attribute values for a particular grid form a
Grid Value Matrix where the matrix entries correspond to the grid cells.

S-100 addresses only a small subset of the possible grids and traversal orders. It
makes use of the CV_DiscreteGridPointCoverage and
CV_ContinuousQuadrilateralGridCoverage described in clauses 6 and 8 respectively of
<<ISO19123>>. It makes use of:

. Rectangular grids and irregularly shaped grids;
. Simple and tiled grids;
. Grid with a regular cell size and variable cell sizes; and
. Grids in 2 or 3 dimensions.

Traversal orders for grids are defined in <<ISO19123,annex=D>>. The types of most
interest to S-100 are: Linear Scan; and Morton Order. <<fig-8-6>> shows a linear scan
traversal order and a Morton traversal order for a grid. The Morton ordering can
easily accommodate irregular shaped grids, and variable cell size grids. The Morton
Order corresponds to a quad tree in two dimensions but is extendable to higher
dimensions.

[[fig-8-6]]

====

These two types of grids and traversal orders have applications for hydrographic data
(for example <<cls-8-5.2.5>> -- Morton Order).

Other traversal orders defined in the <<ISO19123>> are also permitted in S-100
(see <<cls-8-7.7.2>>).

[[cls-8-5.2.3]]
==== Rectangular grids and irregularly shaped grids

The most common type of grid is a rectangular grid. Most images are defined on such a
grid. A rectangular grid is a subtype of quadrilateral grid as defined in
<<ISO19123>>. A quadrilateral grid is a grid in which the curves are straight lines,
and there is one set of grid lines for each dimension of the grid space. In this case
the grid cells are parallelograms or parallelepipeds. A parallelepiped is a
three-dimensional figure like a cube, except that its faces are not squares but
parallelograms.

[[fig-8-7]]
.Rectangular grid
image::img62.png[]

A grid may also have a non-rectangular or quadrilateral boundary. Such grids sometimes
occur when scanning paper charts that include "insets" or "outsets" that change the
boundary of the grid, however the grid can have any shape, as long as it can be
traversed in a sequence that gives order to the cells. <<fig-8-7>> shows a Rectangular
Grid. <<fig-8-8>> shows a quadrilateral grid with an outset, as might occur in a
scanning operation.

[[fig-8-8]]
.Quadrilateral grid with outset
image::img63.png[]

Very irregular shaped grids may be defined but require a more complex traversal rule
than simple linear scanning.

[[cls-8-5.2.4]]
==== Simple and tiled grids

A tiled grid is a combination of two or more grid tessellations for one set of data.
The tiling scheme is essentially a second grid that is superimposed on the first
simple grid. Each cell of the tiling scheme grid is itself a grid. A tiling scheme
grid may also be used with vector data where each cell defines the boundaries of a
particular vector data set. Tiling schemes are of particular value when data is
sparse. For example, a raster image map of the United States might be tiled so that it
is not necessary to include data over Canada or over the ocean to include Alaska and
Hawaii. <<fig-8-9>> illustrates a tiled grid.

[[fig-8-9]]
.Tiled grid

[[cls-8-5.2.5]]
==== Regular and variable cell sizes

Traditional grids are fixed 'resolution', most commonly composed of perpendicularly
crossing lines of equal spacing on each dimension, creating square or rectangular
cells. Gridding is a standard way of generalizing point datasets, by imposing a
resolution or grid spacing, and calculating individual grid cell values based on a
single attribute of the group of points contained within each cell. As well, image
data is primarily gridded, based on the resolution of the sensor or uniform arbitrary
pixel spacing.

Grids may also be established where the cell size varies within the grid. A common
example is the "quad tree" that is commonly used in some Geographic Information
Systems. Having a variable size grid cell allows variable resolution throughout the
gridded surface, which is exhibited by the unequal spacing of parallel lines that form
the grid, localized to given grid cells. This requires the normalization of data on
each dimension, and the binary subdivision of each dimension in order to localize any
given cell. When applied to point or image data, areas of high variability can be
represented by small grid cells. Areas of low variability can be represented by large
grid cells. Of course if the cell size varies in a grid, it must do so in a regular
way so that the grid tessellation still covers the bounded area, and the traversal
method must be able to sequence the cells in an order. In addition it is necessary to
include information that describes the size of each cell with the cell.

[[fig-8-10]]
.Riemann Hyperspatial grid coverage (showing depth from hydrographic sonar)
image::img65.png[]

Data in a grid of variable cell size where adjacent like cells have been aggregated
into larger cells, maintains the integrity of the original uniformly spaced data,
while minimizing storage size. A grid with variable cell size supports null values, so
incomplete data -- that containing holes -- can exist without the need to assign
arbitrary values to regions of no data. This allows for a considerable amount of
compaction over traditional grids because nothing is stored for cells with no data --
they do not exist.

<<fig-8-10>> above illustrates some variable size cells. If four adjacent cells (in
two dimensions) have the same attribute value in the grid value matrix, then they may
aggregated into one larger cell. In two dimensions this is known as a "QuadTree". This
is of particular use in applications where resolution varies, or where data values
tend to cluster.

[[fig-8-11]]
.Variable cell sizes
image::img66.png[]

Variable size cells, as illustrated in <<fig-8-11>>, are particularly useful for
hydrographic data. Instead of representing bottom cover as soundings (point sets) it
can be represented as a set of variable size cells. Each cell can carry several
attribute values. Adjacent cells aggregate so the data volume is greatly diminished.
Small cells exist where there is a rapid change in attribute value from cell to cell.
Shoals, shore line and obstructions result in a number of small cells, where large
relatively constant, or flat areas, such as the bottom of a channel result in a number
of aggregated cells.

The Morton traversal order can handle variable size cells. The traversal progresses as
shown in <<fig-8-12>>. Morton order proceeds from left to right bottom to top cell by
cell regardless of cell size. It increments in the stem:[X] coordinate then the
stem:[Y]. This also extends to multiple dimensions where the increment is in stem:[X],
then stem:[Y] then stem:[Z] then each additional dimension. <<fig-8-13>> shows Morton
ordering in irregular grids and variable size grids. In this example stem:[Y],
stem:[X] ordering is used.

[[fig-8-12]]
.Morton Order (stem:[X],stem:[Y])
image::img67.png[]

Any space filling curve gives order to a bounded space, but the order imparted by the
Morton order preserves nearness. This is a very important property. It means that two
points that are close together in the grid are also close together in traversal order
of the grid. This property derives from Riemann's extension of the Pythagorean Theorem
into multiple dimensions into what is known as Riemann hyperspace.

[[fig-8-13]]
.Morton Order in irregular and variable size grids
image::img68.png[]

[[cls-8-5.2.6]]
==== Grids in 2 or 3 dimensions

Grids may exist in 2 or 3 dimensions. Not all traversal orders will work on higher
dimensional grids, but both the linear scan traversal and Morton order traversal can
be extended to 3 dimensions. Each dimension in an stem:[n]-dimensional grid is
orthogonal to all other dimensions. Thus, in a 3-dimensional grid or equal cell
spacing, there are a set of perpendicularly crossing lines of equal spacing in each
dimension, creating cubic cells. These can be thought of as volume elements -- _voxels_.

A quadrilateral grid can easily be extended to 3 dimensions by repeating the grid for
each cell "layer" in the third dimension. This is commonly done to support multiple
bands of data for the same cell structure, however for true 3 dimensions where the
number of cells in the third dimension is large the data volume can become enormous.
<<fig-8-14>> shows a rectangular grid that is extended into the third dimension by
repeating the grid for four different bands of data. <<fig-8-15>> shows a rectangular
grid extended to cover a volume.

[[fig-8-14]]
.Banding to extend attribute space in a rectangular grid
image::img69.png[]

[[fig-8-15]]
.A rectangular grid extended to cover three dimensional volume
image::img70.png[]

Multidimensional Complex Grids exist in stem:[n]-dimensions and will follow the rules
of both these structures, allowing the creation for multidimensional,
multi-resolution, aggregate structures. In hydrographic applications one is usually
not interested in three dimensional solids but rather the three dimensional
representation of the sea bottom and material, including floating material within the
water volume related to the sea bottom. Such datasets are sparse, where most of the
volume cells (voxels) are empty. If one allows three dimensional cells to aggregate
into larger cells when they are the same (within a pre-defined tolerance), then most
of the empty cells disappear into a few larger aggregations. The use of variable size
cells is useful in handling three and higher dimension data. A variable size cell grid
in three dimensions is illustrated in <<fig-8-16>>.

[[fig-8-16]]

[[cls-8-5.2.7]]
==== TIN

The Triangular Irregular Network is a method of describing variable density coverage
data based on a set of triangles. The TIN structure is very flexible for analysis.
Since each triangle is a locally flat surface it is straight forward to calculate the
intersection of an arbitrary curve with a surface represented as a TIN. Attributes can
be applied to each triangular face, and it is easy, but computationally intensive, to
process the faces geometrically, in order to calculate contour lines. In a dynamic
navigation system one could easily calculate the potential intersection of a ship's
hull with the bottom surface represented as a TIN, and therefore easily determine a
dynamic safe contour. The calculation of the intersection of a vector with the surface
of a TIN triangle is the simple calculation of the intersection of a line and a plane.
An example TIN showing variable size TIN triangles and the TIN vertex points is shown
in <<fig-8-17>>.

[[fig-8-17]]
.An example coverage composed of TIN triangles
image::img72.png[]

A TIN is composed of a set of triangles. The vertices at the corners of each triangle
are shared with the adjacent triangle. These vertices form the control points of the
coverage function. There is an inherent overhead involved in a TIN since one must
store both the triangles and the vertices. Attribute values are attached to the
triangles, whereas the geometry is derived from the position of the vertices. A TIN
may be described either by having the triangles reference the shared vertices at their
corners, or by having the vertices indicate which triangles they are attached to.
Having the triangles reference the vertices is the simpler structure since each
triangle has exactly 3 vertices, whereas a vertex may be shared between a variable
number of triangles.

A TIN is useful in representing variable density data, since the triangles may be
larger where the data is locally smooth, and more dense to represent data with more
rapidly changing values. If the points of the TIN are carefully chosen to represent
ridges, valleys and other significant features, then the TIN can result in a
significant data compaction; however, if a TIN is automatically generated from an
arbitrary set of data points the data volume can increase over the original source
data, or significant information can be lost, Since a TIN coverage can be of any shape
it can be fitted to cover an area of interest.

S-100 uses the CV_TINCoverage class described in <<ISO19123>>. TIN coverages in S-100
are continuous coverages.

[[cls-8-5.2.8]]
==== Grid cell structure

The feature attribute values associated with a grid point represent characteristics of
the real world measured or observed within a small space surrounding a sample point
represented by the grid point. The grid lines connecting these points form a set of
grid cells.

[example]
In <<fig-8-18>> below, the grid points are (stem:[a], stem:[b], stem:[c], stem:[d]),
located at the intersections of the solid lines. The cells (stem:[A], stem:[B],
stem:[C], stem:[D]) bounded by dashed lines represent the sample spaces associated
with these grid points. These sample spaces are grid cells in an offset grid
(represented by the dashed lines) relative to the data grid (represented by the solid
lines). Evaluation at any direct position stem:[X] within the grid cell stem:[G]
(bounded by the solid lines) will be based on interpolation from stem:[a], stem:[b],
stem:[c] and stem:[d] (and possibly involve additional grid points outside the cell).

[[fig-8-18]]
.Grid cell structure (after <<ISO19123,figure=15>>)
image::img73.png[]

S-100 utilizes the same view of grid cell structure as <<ISO19123,section=8.2.2>>. The
grid data in S-100 grid coverages are nominally situated exactly at the grid points
defined by the grid coordinates. The grid points are therefore the "sample points."
Data values at a sample point represent measurements over a neighbourhood of the
sample point. This neighbourhood is assumed to extend a half-cell in each dimension.
The effect is that the sample space corresponding to each grid point is a cell centred
at the grid point. S-100 refines the <<ISO19123>> view by adding optional attributes
to indicate the location of the data values relative to the grid cell corners as
encoded in the grid dataset. These optional attributes can be used to effectively
avoid offset grids or subdivision of grid cells during evaluation and portrayal, or
for more complex representations of gridded data.

Note that applying interpolation methods to a coverage means that the value of a data
characteristic at a location between grid points may be different from that at any or
all of the grid points which are its nearest neighbours. Such differentiation may be
avoided by means of the additional S-100 attributes mentioned above.

[[cls-8-5.3]]
=== Dataset structure

A dataset consists of a collection of one or more coverages together with associated
metadata. Metadata may be associated with the dataset as a whole, or with individual
coverages. Metadata may also be associated with particular data elements where needed.
More detailed metadata at a lower level overrides general metadata for an entire
coverage or collection. Metadata may also be associated with particular regions of a
dataset or other grouping of dataset elements.

The description of metadata may be organized in several different ways. In this
Standard the metadata is organized into modules. The S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata
module relates to the dataset as a whole, and is described in <<Part17>>. The
S100_IF_CollectionMetadata module refers to the S100_IF_StructuralMetadata module, the
S100_IF_AcquisitionMetadata module and the S100_IF_QualityMetadata module as
sub-components. S100_IF_CollectionMetadata may be encoded within the dataset file or
externally. Structural, acquisition, and quality metadata are optional except for
required elements defining the coverage format, which are specified in <<Part10c>>.

Coverages or Point Set data may also be organized into tiles. Metadata may also be
associated with a tile. The overall structure of a dataset is illustrated in
<<fig-8-19>>.

.Data Set Structure (adapted from <<ISO19129,figure=7>> - IGCD Structure and Metadata)

[[cls-8-5.3.1]]
==== S100_Dataset

A dataset is an identifiable collection of data that can be represented in an exchange
format or stored on a storage media. A dataset can represent all or a part of a
logical data collection and may include one or many tiles of data. The content of a
dataset is defined by the Product Specification for that particular type of data and
is normally suited to the use of that data. A Product Specification for a particular
data type needs to have a plan that indicates the organization of that data product.
For example, a simple gridded bathymetry model based product may have only one
bathymetry grid coverage, and a tiling scheme that indicates that every dataset
contains one tile. More complex products may include several collocated coverages and
more complex tiling schemes such as a quad tree based variable size tiling scheme,
where one dataset may, at times contain more than one tile. The dataset is the logical
entity that can be identified by the associated discovery metadata, not the physical
entity of exchange.

[[cls-8-5.3.2]]
==== S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata

Associated with a dataset is a set of discovery metadata that describes the dataset so
that it can be accessed. It consists of the dataset discovery metadata defined in
<<Part17>>.

[[cls-8-5.3.3]]
==== S100_ExchangeSet

The nominal transmittal for S-100 datasets is via Exchange Sets. An Exchange Set
represents the physical entity of exchange. The transmittal is dependent upon the
encoding format and the exchange media. A transmittal on a physical media such as a
DVD may carry a number of datasets, whereas a transmittal over a low bandwidth
telecommunications line may carry only a small part of a dataset. Any metadata carried
with a transmittal is integral to the transmittal and may be changed by the exchange
mechanism to other exchange metadata as required for the routing and delivery of the
transmittal. A common exchange mechanism would be to carry a whole dataset on one
physical media such as a CD-ROM. Transmittal metadata is not shown because any
transmittal metadata, exclusive of the information in the
S100_DatasetDiscoveryMetadata module, is dependent upon the mechanism used for
exchange, and may differ from one exchange media or encoding format to another. An
example oftransmittal metadata would be counts of the number of data bytes in a unit
of exchange.

[[cls-8-5.3.4]]
==== S100_IF_Collection

An S100_IF_Collection represents a collection of data. A collection may include
multiple different data types over a particular area, or multiple coverages of data of
the same coverage type, but representing different surfaces. For example a collection
may consist of a grid coverage and a point set over the same area, where the grid
coverage represents a bathymetry surface and the point set a number of sounding points.

information, and dataset content. These metadata classes are descriptive metadata
