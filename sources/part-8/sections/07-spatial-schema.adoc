== Spatial Schema

Each of the S100_IF_Coverage subclasses has a specific Spatial Schema that describes
the structure of that data type. The data types identified in <<cls-8-5.3>> are:

. S100_IF_PointCoverage:
. S100_IF_TINCoverage; and
. S100_IF_GridCoverage.

The conceptual models of these coverage subclasses make use of point sets and
geometry/value pairs, which are described by the classes S100_IF_PointSet and
CV_GeometryValuePair and its subclasses.

[[cls-8-7.1]]
=== S100_IF_PointSet spatial model

An S100_Point is a single point referenced to a 3-D coordinate reference system. Its
value is carried as a coordinate rather than an attribute. Such points are generated
by certain types of sensors. An S100_IF_PointSet is not a coverage. A Point Set can
be used to generate a Point Coverage. The class S100_IF_PointSet is illustrated in
<<fig-8-21>>.

[[fig-8-21]]
.S100_IF_PointSet

The attribute _geometry_ contains an instance of GM_Point.

[[cls-8-7.2]]
=== CV_GeometryValuePair and subclasses

The class CV_GeometryValuePair describes an element of a set that defines the
relationships of a discrete coverage. Each member of this class consists of two
parts: a domain object from the domain of the coverage to which it belongs; and a
record of feature attribute values from the range of the coverage to which it
belongs. CV_GeometryValuePair may be generated in the execution of an evaluate
operation; and need not be persistent. CV_GeometryValuePair is subclassed (see
<<cls-8-5>>) to restrict the pairing of a feature attribute value record to a
specific subtype of domain object.

=== S100_IF_PointCoverage spatial model

An S100_IF_PointCoverage is a type of CV_DiscretePointCoverage from <<ISO19123>>. The
attribute values in the value record for each CV_GeometryValuePair represent values
of the coverage, such as bathymetric soundings.

The class S100_IF_PointCoverage (<<fig-8-22>>) represents a set of values, such as
bathymetric depth values, assigned to a set of arbitrary stem:[X], stem:[Y] points.
Each point is identified by a horizontal coordinate geometry pair stem:[(X,Y)] and
assigned one or more values as attribute values. These values are organized in a
record for each point.

that obstructions such as rocks or shoals are emphasised. In the case of discrete
point coverages, _commonPointRule_ is relevant only if a spatial query returns more
than one point element of the coverage within the tolerance of the query.

[[cls-8-7.4]]
=== S100_IF_TINCoverage spatial model

A TIN coverage is a type of CV_ContinousCoverage as described in <<ISO19123>>. The
attribute values in the value record for each CV_GeometryValuePair represent values
for each of the vertex corners of the triangle. Any additional attributes related to
a TIN triangle may be described as attributes of CV_ValueTriangle.

A TIN covers an area with a unique set of non-overlapping triangles where each
triangle is formed by three points. The geometry for a TIN is described in
<<ISO19107>> and a TIN coverage is described in <<ISO19123>>. TIN coverages are
particularly useful for representing elevation or bathymetry in some applications. It
is easier to calculate an intersection with a coverage surface when it is represented
as a TIN. The class S100_IF_TINCoverage is illustrated in <<fig-8-23>>.

[[note5]]
[NOTE]

The attribute _interpolationType_ specifies the interpolation method recommended for
the evaluation of the S100_IF_TINCoverage where the value is taken from the codelist
CV_InterpolationMethod with the value "barycentric". The barycentric position S
within a value triangle composed of the CV_PointValuePairs stem:[(P1, V1)],
stem:[(P2, V2)], and stem:[(P3, V3)], is stem:[(i, j, k)], where
stem:[S = iP1 + jP2 + kP3] and the interpolated attribute value at stem:[S] is
stem:[V = iV1 + jV2 +kV3].
====

[[note6]]
[NOTE]
====
The triangles lie on a 2 dimensional manifold with the stem:[X], stem:[Y] coordinates
of the points at the vertices of the triangles representing the position on the
manifold and the attribute. Three vertex points define a triangle. The attribute
_geometry_ for a TIN vertex is an instance of GM_Point. The attribute value contains
a record restricted to one entry that defines the coverage value at the vertex (for
example depth for a bathymetric TIN vertex point).

[[cls-8-7.5]]
=== S100_IF_GridCoverage spatial model

The class S100_IF_GridCoverage (<<fig-8-24>> below) represents a set of values
assigned to the points in a 2D grid. Several organizations of grids are available
from <<ISO19123>> with different grid traversal orders, and variable or fixed grid
cell sizes. S-100 makes use of two types of grid organizations, the simple
quadrilateral grid with equal cell sizes traversed by a linear sequence rule, and the
variable cell size quadrilateral grid traversed by a Morton Order sequence rule. This
variable cell size grid organization is known as the Quad Tree for a two dimensional
grid.

Only the values "linear" (for a simple regular cell size grid) and "Morton" (for a
Quad Tree Grid) shall be used for data that conforms to this standard. The sequence
rule for a regular cell size grid is simple. When the cells are all of the same size,
the cell index can be derived from the position of the Record within the sequence of
Records. For a variable cell size grid the sequence order is more complex. The cell
index either needs to be carried with each of the associated record values or it can
be calculated based on each cell size.

[[note13]]
[NOTE]
====
For simple grids with equal cell sizes the _sequencingRule_ attribute of an
S100_IF_Grid equals "linear" and the offset vector establishes the cell size. The
attribute extent specifies the area of the grid for which data is provided. For
variable cell size grids (Quad Tree grids) the _sequencingRule_ attribute equals
Morton and the offset vector establishes the minimum cell size. The actual cell size
is included as an attribute in the data record that describes the level of
aggregation of the quad structure. The attribute _extent_ specifies a bounding
rectangle within which data is provided. Which cells are included in the dataset is
determined from the Morton ordered sequence of cells.

=== Rectified or georeferenceable grids

The S100_IF_Grid model described in <<cls-8-7.5>> is capable of representing
rectified grids as well as referenceable grids. The model given below in <<fig-8-25>>
below shows that a Grid can be of two types Rectified or Georeferenceable; and that
the GridValuesMatrix is a subtype of the general grid object. The referenceable grid
type is a subclass of CV_Grid and does not add attributes. The difference between
georectified and georeferenceable grids lies in the operations for coordinate
conversion:

* For georectified grids, the operation to map grid coordinates to direct positions
uses the values of the attributes _origin_ and _offsetVectors_ in an affine
transformation.
* For georeferenceable grids, the operation to map grid coordinates to direct
positions is not defined in terms of _origin_ and _offset verctor_. It there is no
predefined association between one cell's location and that of another; each cell's
location might be independently calculated.

[[fig-8-25]]
.Rectified or georeferenceable grids
image::img80.png[]

A Rectified Grid is related to the Coordinate Reference System through the attribute
_origin_, the orientation of the grid axes, and the spacing between the grid lines.
For Rectified Grids, there is an affine relationship between the grid and the
external coordinate system.

A Referenceable Grid may be related to a Coordinate Reference System through a
Transform operation that allows the location of all points in the grid to be
determined in the Coordinate Reference System, but the location of the points is not
directly available from the grid coordinates; as opposed to a rectified grid where
the location of the points in the Coordinate Reference System is derivable from the
properties of the grid itself.

The S-100 model does not use coordinate transformations for georeferenceable grids.
Instead, the Direct Positions of the grid points are encoded along with the value
record for each grid point.

[[cls-8-7.7]]
=== Common enumerations

[[cls-8-7.7.1]]
==== CV_CommonPointRule

<<ISO19123>> states that "CV_CommonPointRule is a list of codes that identify methods
for handling cases where the DirectPosition input to the evaluate operation falls
within two or more of the geometric objects. The interpretation of these rules
differs between discrete and continuous coverages. In the case of a discrete
coverage, each CV_GeometryValuePair provides one value for each attribute. The rule
is applied to the set of values associated with the set of CV_GeometryValuePairs that
contain the DirectPosition. In the case of a continuous coverage, a value for each
attribute shall be interpolated for each CV_ValueObject that contains the
DirectPosition. The rule shall then be applied to the set of interpolated values for
each attribute."

location is compatible with the sequence rule and scan direction; for example, linear
sequencing would be incompatible with a start location at the upper bound of the grid
bounding box and forward scan order in _scanDirection_.

to produce the Morton code of the grid point. The method is documented in computer
science textbooks as well as <<ISO19123>> and other accessible articles. Hilbert
curves are more complex but descriptions are available in computer science and other
reference texts (for example, the non-normative references in <<Part10c>>).
