== Quality Model for Imagery and Gridded Data

The following is a list of quality elements test procedures that addresses imagery.
Quality elements for gridded and coverage data are described in S-100 Part 4c and
<<S97,part=C>>.

=== Top-level classes of the quality-model

* General image quality
* Visual inspection and evaluation of image geometry
* Analytical inspection and evaluation of image geometry
* Visual inspection and evaluation of image radiometry
* Analytical inspection and evaluation of image radiometry

The following listings are non-exhaustive listings of the subclasses of the quality
model.

=== Class General image quality

* check parameters affecting the quality (data compression etc.)
* make test scanning or test imaging

=== Class Visual inspection and evaluation of image geometry

* check number of channels (black&white, colour, multispectral, etc.)
* check edge-matching
* check event of blurring
* check rectification errors
* check "pixel-stretching"
* check overlay with vector data (other mapping data, map-frame)
* check overlay with other raster or gridded data
* identify source of data
* inspect documentation of the quality of the sensor or the scanner (calibration data)
* inspect documentation of previous processing step (image enhancements)
* check resolution of imaged test patterns

=== Class Analytical inspection and evaluation of image geometry

* check seam lines of mosaics
* check colour stability / homogeneity / balance
* check grade of illumination of the image (hot spot)
* check histogram
* check coloured fringes along lines with high contrast

=== Class Visual inspection and evaluation of image radiometry

* calculate geometric residuals at checkpoints in 2D and/or in 3D
* calculate residuals in range at checkpoints

=== Class Analytical inspection and evaluation of image radiometry

* calculate contrast
* calculate brightness
