== Imagery and Gridded Data Portrayal

The mechanism for portrayal is out of scope for this component of S-100. It is
described in the Portrayal component of S-100 Parts 9 and 9a. The basic mechanism for
feature centric rule based portrayal is given in <<ISO19117>> "Portrayal". However,
certain information may need to be carried with a set of imagery and gridded data to
support external portrayal mechanisms.
