== Tiling Scheme

Tiling is one method of reducing the volume of data in a dataset to manageable
proportions. In a dataset there must be information both describing the tiling scheme
and also about the instance of a tile or tiles carried in that particular dataset. The
class S100_TilingScheme carries information about the tiling scheme as a whole. There
may only be one tiling scheme defined for a particular data collection. Within a data
warehouse (database) there may be several overlapping tiling schemes defined where any
of the tiling schemes may be used as the basis of data extraction from the data warehouse.

A tiling scheme is itself a discrete coverage. It is normally a simple rectangular
grid with tiles of equal density. Such a grid coverage may also be defined with tiles
of variable density. A more complex tiling scheme may also be defined as a discrete
polygon coverage. An example is a data collection consisting of elevation cut along
political boundaries. These types of tiling schemes are illustrated in <<fig-8-20>>.
Other tiling schemes are also possible. In fact, any type of discrete coverage may be
used to establish a tiling scheme.

Any tiling scheme used must be completely described as part of the Product
Specification for a particular data product. This includes the dimensions, location
and data density of tiles as well as a tile identification mechanism (tileID).
