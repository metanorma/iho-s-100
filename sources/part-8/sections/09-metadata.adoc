== Metadata

The metadata for all types of geographic data is covered in the metadata standard
<<ISO19115-1>> _Geographic information - Metadata_. This standard includes mandatory
identification metadata that describes the data set. It also includes some metadata
describing the content of a data set. Much of the metadata corresponding to vector
based geometric data does not apply to imagery and gridded data.

S-100 uses the metadata elements in <<ISO19115-1>>, where possible, to address the
basic metadata requirements for geographic data, including Imagery, Gridded, and
Coverage data. Other metadata elements primarily related to acquisition and
processing are addressed in <<ISO19115-2>> _Geographic information - Metadata - Part
2: Extensions for imagery and gridded data_. Quality metadata is described in
<<ISO19157>> _Geographic information - Data Quality_. The minimum amount of metadata
required to describe geographic data is addressed in <<ISO19115-1>>. The details of
sensor models and their associated data models and metadata are provided in
<<ISO19130>> _Geographic information - Sensor and data models for imagery and gridded
data_.

Metadata for S-100 is described in S-100 Parts 4a-4c. The specific metadata for S-100
Imagery and Gridded Data is shown in <<app-8-D>>. The data format representations for
S-100 metadata are described in S-100 Parts 10c and 17.

Suggested metadata supporting a scanned paper chart in compliance with  <<S61>> is
described in <<app-8-D>> (<<cls-8-D-4>>).
