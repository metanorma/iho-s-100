== Quality

The general concept for handling quality in the ISO 19100 series of standards is
defined in the <<ISO19113>> "Quality principles". The procedures to evaluate quality
are defined in the <<ISO19114>> "Quality evaluation procedures". <<ISO19138>> "Data
quality measures" provides a definitive set of measures. The metadata quality
elements from <<<ISO19115>> have been moved to a new standard <<ISO19157>> Geographic
information -- Data quality.

The <<ISO19129>> standardizes quality aspects that are specific for imagery, gridded,
and coverage data. The testing of the quality according to this standard is model
based. The quality measures are attributes or constraints of the classes of the
model. <<app-8-C>> shows the proposed top-level classes of the quality model.
