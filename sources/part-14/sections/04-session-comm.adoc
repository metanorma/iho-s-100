== Session oriented communication

To define the context for information exchange the concept of a session
shall be used.

A session oriented service typically contains three components, each
handling other types of data:

* Session component: Describing the handling of the session data (service
request, service response, login, login response, logout).
* Service component: Describing the information to maintain the service
(for example keep alive messages, service status).
* Data component: Describing the data itself; for example Vessel Traffic
Image data (objects).

Further Metadata required for each component can be detailed in a Product
Specification.

In a session oriented service the interfaces are point-to-point
connections between client and server. Client and server manage the
session (see <<fig-14-3>>) and exchange information bi-directionally. The
service description should contain an interaction model. The interaction
model should describe the life span of a session (initiation, maintenance
and termination of the session).

For each element in the interaction model a detailed description shall be
provided in the Product Specification of the service. This is to ensure
that the service interaction is harmonized and reliable. For example, a
description of the protocol used in a service may provide sufficient
feedback to ensure full reception of the data, if this is essential for
the service.

For each service using the session concept interactions can be defined.
For example the following messages:

* Initiate the Session
** Initiate and confirm Sessions
* Maintenance of Session
** Keep alive messages
* Termination of the Session
** Closing Session Request
