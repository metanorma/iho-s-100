== Session-less interactive communication

Interactive communication is broadly used in application to application
data exchange. Mostly the client server communication pattern is applied.
Clients initiate communication with a server and both partners exchange
messages as (defined) sets of data.

Following the concepts of stateless communication paradigms a session-less
message exchange requires an encapsulation of all relevant information
within a request. Based solely on this information, the server shall be
able to formulate an appropriate response. Metadata will either be part of
this response or shall be provided within the service specification. All
operations are service-specific and are therefore not considered here.
