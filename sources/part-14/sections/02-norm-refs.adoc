== Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)

This Part makes references to the ISO/OSI standard reference model for
open systems interconnection <<ISO7498>>, but it does not adhere to that
standard with regard to the exact services provided. The ISO/OSI standard
is used as a reference for the naming of the individual layers in the
protocol stack (see <<fig-14-1>>).

The following conventions apply:

* with respect to functionality, the protocol definitions cover the
session, the presentation and the application layers of the OSI model (the
A-profile);
* the protocol requires a set of transport services. The services can
possibly be supplied by any number of different transport protocol stacks
(T-profiles);
* this Part does not describe the A-profile as layered. This Part merges
all the upper three layers of the ISO/OSI model into one protocol;
* this Part refers to the companion standards or user layer as a distinct
protocol layer on top of the application layer.
