== Example: Efficient Data Broadcasting

This example describes a service providing data broadcasting. The service
embeds the data structure given by an external Product Specification. The
data items, structured according to the Product Specification are
broadcast via a communication medium (for example VDES). Therefore they
are serialized and sent in conformity with the <<ISO8211>> encoding
defined within the standard (<<Part10a>>).

<<fig-14-A-1>> shows how to exchange information efficiently. Static data,
such as the data structure according to the product definition, is
considered part of the service specification (StaticData_ISO8211). Since
the client must already know this information in order to use the
service, only an exchange of the dynamic data is necessary
(DynamicData_ISO8211). The service provider reduces the data set
serialized in <<ISO8211>> by removing all static data that has already
been covered within the service specification. The client receives the
data and merges it with the static data record. In this way, the entire
data set can be reconstructed. The basis for such a concept is the
Insert, Delete, and Modify mechanism as described in <<Part10a>>.
Therefore, it is possible to represent both static and dynamic data
separately as <<ISO8211>> compliant.
