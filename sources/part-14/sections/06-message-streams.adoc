== Message streams

Message streams are a unidirectional flow of messages containing
well-defined sets of data. The used communication medium can ensure
sequence and completeness of the message stream.

Contrary to the session concept broadcasted messages are mostly context
agnostic. It is possible but not necessary that the message stream from
the server is triggered by a message from a client. Therefore, clients can
broadcast an undirected request for information followed by an undirected
answer by a server. An identifier has to be provided to associate a
response message to a request. Message stream messages have to include
metadata about the transferred datasets.
