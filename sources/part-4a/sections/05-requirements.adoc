== Requirements

=== Business purpose and Intended use

Metadata can satisfy a number of uses:

. Data Discovery - summary descriptions of content and quality, contact details,
off-line distribution and on-line references (URL) for on-line viewing.
. Data use - more extensive information on data coverage, maintenance, content and
details of data creation. It includes additional contact, distribution and quality
details.
. Data Fitness -- additional detail about use, limitations, format, age, and extents.
This level of metadata assists the user to determine the data's suitability for use.
. Data Sharing -- further detail relating to data content, transfer formats, and spatial
representation.
. Data Management -- the most detailed level of metadata, which includes information on
the data quality regimes and data quality test results. This type of information is
sometimes important when data is exchanged between organizations.

.Business Purpose
image::img29.png[]

<<fig-4a-1>> above illustrates the relationship between the types of metadata required
by different user communities, and the scope of this profile. Each S-100 based Product
Specification will describe the source and feature-level metadata that will be required
to support data use, data sharing, and data management. The more demanding requirements
for comprehensive metadata (as illustrated by "Doers" in <<fig-4a-1>>), require further
attribution to allow source selection and feature analysis.

<<ISO19115-1>> does not provide all the metadata necessary to describe imagery. This has
been included in <<ISO19115-2>>, which incorporates elements that are needed for
the description of imagery and gridded data. <<ISO19130>>,
is an important standard associated with <<ISO19115-2>>, as
it specifies the information required to support the geolocation of georeferenceable
imagery, including a sensor description and associated physical information defined by a
sensor model, fitting functions, and ground control points. It describes how the sensor
measurements and the geolocation information are logically associated. In particular,
<<ISO19130>> describes the sensor and data model for hydrographic sonar requirements, and
the associated metadata. This will be described in relevant Product Specifications.

An XML implementation of the <<ISO19115-1>> which describes how the abstract UML models in
<<ISO19115-1>> are converted into XML is documented in ISO publication <<ISO19115-3>>.

Although this profile is largely based on the above mentioned standards, reference to
additional standards will need to be made. (See <<cls-4a-4>>).

This Profile defines:

. Mandatory and conditional metadata sections, metadata entities, and metadata elements;
. The minimum set of metadata elements for any resource in order to conform to this
Profile;
. The core metadata for geographic datasets;
. Optional metadata elements that allow for a more extensive standard description of
resources; and
. The option to extend the Profile to cater for specialised needs.

Implementation of the Profile is based on ISO/TS 19115-3:2016, and includes:

. The use of the <<ISO19115-3>> XSDs;
. XML documents containing dictionaries to implement the <<ISO19115-1>> codelists (XML
data dictionaries of the <<ISO19115-1>> codelists in GML format); and
. XML data dictionaries of the S-100 Geographic Extent identifier
codelists{blank}footnote:[Reference to codelists of geographic identifiers to be
provided. They do not appear in the <<ISO19115>> codelists.].

While the UML class _S100_Metadata_ specialises the class _MD_Metadata_, the
specialisation only involves restrictions of the parent class. Hence, for the purpose of
XML implementation, the _MD_Metadata_ element shall be used to support interoperability
with other ISO 19100 standards for geographic information.

=== Metadata for describing geographic data and other resources

The Profile identifies the metadata required to describe digital geographic data and
resources, and is applicable to independent datasets, dataset aggregations, geographic
features, feature classes and attributes. Metadata is documented via the creation of XML
document instances, which are validated against the S-100 Metadata Profile XSDs, and
relevant codelists and enumerations{blank}footnote:[Enumeration: A fixed list of valid
identifiers of named literal values. Attributes of an enumerated type may only take
values from this list (source: <<ISO19136>>.].

If a Product Specification extends the metadata of this profile, the rules in
<<app-4a-D>> must be followed, and the Product Specification must provide a metadata
Schema to validate metadata against.

Metadata records must contain a minimum set of core elements (see <<cls-4a-5.3>>) which
are necessary for conformance with this Profile. A number of additional elements
required for discovery purposes have also been identified and are described in the
<<app-4a-C>>.

Quality information is important for assessing whether datasets or resources are fit for
use, and quality metadata have therefore been documented in <<Part4c>>.

[[cls-4a-5.3]]
=== Obligations/conditions

Obligation descriptors have been included to provide an indication of whether a metadata
entity or element must be documented or may be conditionally or unconditionally left to
the discretion of the metadata encoder. This descriptor may have the following values: M
(mandatory), C (conditional) or O (optional). The following definitions form
<<ISO19115-1,clause="B.1.4">> are included below.

A *mandatory (M)* obligation means the metadata class or metadata element shall be
documented.

A *conditional (C)* obligation specifies an electronically manageable condition under
which at least one metadata class or a metadata element is mandatory. 'Conditional' is
used for one of the three following possibilities:

. Expressing a choice between two or more options. At least one option is mandatory and
must be documented.
. Documenting a metadata class or a metadata element if another element has been
documented.
. Documenting a metadata element if a specific value for another metadata element has
been documented.

If the answer to the condition is positive, then the metadata entity or the metadata
element shall be mandatory.

An *optional (O)* obligation means that the metadata class or the metadata element may
be documented or may not be documented. Optional metadata classes and optional metadata
elements have been defined to provide a guide to those looking to fully document their
data. (Use of this common set of defined elements will help promote interoperability
among geographic data users and producers world-wide.) If an optional class is not used,
the elements contained within that class (including mandatory elements) will also not be
used. Optional classes may have mandatory elements; those elements only become mandatory
if the optional entity is used.

=== Minimum metadata requirements

The minimum requirements for recording metadata include a number of elements that must
be completed in order to conform to this Profile. It should be noted that the obligation
is not mandatory for all elements, however some conditional elements may become
mandatory under certain conditions (for example _resourceType_).

<<tab-4a-1>> identifies the minimum set of metadata elements that should be completed
for datasets and other resources. These elements also form part of the minimum metadata
for geographic datasets listed in <<tab-4a-2>>.

=== S-100 compliancy categories

When implementing S-100 support, different systems may have different requirements to
S-100 based products and their adherence to the S-100 framework. ECDIS may require a
very high degree of compliance; while a reporting system may require a lower degree of
compliance by, for example, not needing an S-100 based exchange method. To facilitate a
means of communicating the intent of a Product Specification and resulting products an
S-100 compliance category can be declared. Four categories are defined.

==== Category 1 - IHO S-100 object model compliant

The Product Specification contains an object model which is available as a Feature
Catalogue from the IHO S-100 GI Registry and is compliant with the S-100 spatial model
(<<Part7;and!Part8>>).

==== Category 2 - IHO S-100 compliant with non-standard encoding

The Product Specification adheres to the minimum requirements of <<Part11>>. The
Product Specification specifies which of the <<Part10a>>, <<Part10b;and!Part10c>> encoding methods is used; or
it specifies another encoding, including how it maps to the S-100 GFM. Metadata is
according to Part 4a, <<Part4b;and!Part4c>> a profile of Part 4a,
<<Part4b;and!Part4c>> or an extension according to Part 4a, <<Part4b;and!Part4c>> rules.

==== Category 3 - IHO S-100 compliant with standard encoding

As Level 2 with the following restrictions:

* The Product Specification uses only an encoding method defined in <<Part10a>>, <<Part10b;and!Part10c>>.

==== Category 4 - - IHO S-100 and IMO harmonized display compliant

As Level 3 with the following restrictions:

* Metadata is according to Part 4a, <<Part4b;and!Part4c>> or a
profile of Part 4a, <<Part4b;and!Part4c>> metadata;
* The Product Specification includes a Portrayal Catalogue available from the IHO S-100
GI Registry;
* The Product Specification includes defined methods for the S-100 defined cyber
security scheme (at a minimum including digital signature and, if applicable, the method
of encryption);
* Test material is embedded into the Product Specification or test material is available
in a separate package. The test cases and related material is at a minimum comparable to
IHO Publication <<S64>> for <<S52>>/<<S57>>/<<S62>>/<<S63>>);
* The Product Specification uses a CRS from the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry. EPSG
CRSs which do not comply with the requirements of <<Part6>> or the selected encoding
method defined in <<Part10a>>, <<Part10b;and!Part10c>> should not be used;
* If appropriate, the Product Specification includes an Alerts and Indications Catalogue
available from the IHO S-100 GI Registry; and
* If appropriate, the Product Specification is compliant with the Interoperability
Catalogue available from the IHO S-100 GI Registry.

=== Recommended metadata for geographic datasets

Although <<ISO19115-1>> defines an extensive set of metadata elements, only a subset of
these are used. It is essential however that a minimum number of metadata elements be
maintained for a dataset (as listed in <<tab-4a-1>>). When describing geographic
datasets however, it is recommended that additional metadata elements (in addition to
the minimum requirements for geographic datasets) be used. This set of metadata, which
includes the minimum set of metadata and some additional optional elements, is referred
to as *recommended metadata*. <<tab-4a-4>> lists the recommended metadata required to
describe a _dataset_, typically for catalogue purposes. This list contains metadata
answering the following questions:

. 'Does a dataset on a specific topic exist ("what")?'
. 'For a specific place ("where")?'
. 'For a specific date or period ("when")?'
. 'A point of contact to learn more about or order the dataset ("who")?'

By using the core metadata described below, interoperability will be enhanced, and
potential users should be able to understand without ambiguity the characteristics of
geographic datasets or resources.

Source: Adapted from <<ISO19115,table=3>>.

Mandatory attributes are nillable.

=== Variations and preferences

==== Metadata element metadataIdentifier

The obligation for the metadata element _metadataIdentifier_ is 'optional' in
<<ISO19115-1>>, however this profile applies a more stringent obligation and defines an
extension to make the obligation '*mandatory*'. Each Product Specification will provide
rules for creating file identifiers.

For example, this could support linkage between parent and child metadata records. The
identifier code of the child's _parentMetadata/CI_Citation.identifier_ element is the
same as the identifier code of the parent's _metadataIdentifier_ element, thus
supporting the hierarchical relationship between metadata records.

==== Metadata element parentMetadata

The metadata element _parentMetadata_ (conditional obligation) is included as a
recommended metadata element for describing geographic datasets in the profile. Under
certain conditions this metadata element is mandatory. For instance, in some cases
dataset metadata may be part of a dataset series. In these circumstances
_parentMetadata_ shall be populated.

The concept of metadata scope allows a dataset to be described in more than one metadata
record. A dataset may be part of a collection, and in this instance, the dataset may be
described in two metadata records: as a dataset in its own right and as part of a
collection. The dataset may also be more discrete. For example, a chart may be described
individually and as part of a collection or (chart series). An organization may choose
to produce a metadata record for each chart and a metadata record for the collection
(chart series). Further information on metadata scope and their implementation is
available in <<ISO19115-1,annex="D">> and <<ISO19115-1,annex="E">>.

[[cls-4a-5.7.3]]
==== Geographic extent of the dataset

The <<ISO19115-1>> condition for spatial extent determines that if the _resourceScope_ is
'dataset' then either the _geographic bounding box_ or the _geographic description_ is
mandatory (<<ISO19115-1,table="B.3">>). To make spatial searches more effective, it is
recommended that the extent be described as a geographic bounding box in preference to a
geographic description. Completing only the geographic description code may not satisfy
the needs of spatial searches as an extent could be ambiguous (for example, 'France'
could mean the mainland only or it may include all external territories). However, in
other circumstances, the geographic descriptions are clearly defined, and can present a
more efficient means of description. Therefore, Product Specifications shall specify how
geographic extent of a dataset is described.

==== Data and Date Time information

Dates for both the metadata and the actual data must be provided. In MD_Metadata, there
is a date stamp for the metadata. In the citation, provided as part of
MD_Identification, there is a production, publication, or revision date for the dataset.
These dates are not necessarily the same. In some cases, one set of metadata may be
provided for multiple sets of data, which may have been produced, published or revised
at different times. The need for an associated date of origin is not restricted to
digital or geographic data. Users who derive results from reprocessed data need to know
the version of the data they are using.

==== Metadata extension information

The _S100_Metadata_ class specialises the _MD_Metadata_ class, restricting the
obligation of _metadataIdentifier_ from optional to mandatory. <<tab-4a-5;and!tab-4a-6>>
provide relevant information about the extension for _S100_Metadata._ A modified UML
diagram is provided at <<app-4a-A>>, the modified values for the data dictionary are
provided at <<app-4a-B>> (<<tab-4a-B-1>>).

=== Metadata for services

The elements to be used for discovery of services are listed in <<tab-4a-7>>. The
elements are similar to those used for datasets except that SV_ServiceIdentification
replaces MD_DataIdentification and two conditional elements are added to document the
coupling (if any) between the service and a dataset.

This edition of the S-100 profile of metadata for services does not document the
operations proffered by services. Accordingly, the profile omits the optional metadata
elements and attributes related to operation information that are defined in <<ISO19115-1>>.
