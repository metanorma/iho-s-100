== Conformance

This profile consists of simple geometry based on three criteria -- complexity,
dimensionality and functional complexity. The first two criteria (complexity and
dimensionality) determine the types defined in this profile that shall be
implemented according to an Application Schema that conforms to a given
conformance option.

There are:

Two levels of complexity:

. Geometric Primitives
. Geometric Complexes;

Four levels of dimensionality:

. 0-dimensional objects
. 0- and 1-dimensional objects
. 0-, 1- and 2-dimensional objects
. 0-, 1-, 2- and 2.5 -dimensional objects; and

One level of functional complexity:

. Data types only (operations are not included).

This profile satisfies the conformance classes A.1.1.1, A.1.1.2, A.1.1.3, A.2.1.1
and A.2.1.2 in <<ISO19107>>. This profile conforms to conformance class 2 of
<<ISO19106>>.
