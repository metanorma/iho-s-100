The following describes the geometrical elements of the curve example (<<fig-7-A.1>>).

C1 (GM_Curve) consists of CS1, CS2 and CS3 (GM_CurveSegment). CS1 uses a geodetic
interpolation, CS2 linear and CS3 circularArc3Points. SP (start point) and EP (end
point) (GM_Point) are the start and end points of C1 and can also be used
indirectly as a 0 dimension position for a point feature. An array of control
points for each segment consists of a combination of SP, EP and vertices as
indicated in the above diagram. The orientation of C1 is + (forward) from SP to EP.

=== Surface Example

The following describes the geometrical elements of the surface example
(<<fig-7-A.2>>).

S1 (GM_Surface) is represented by the surface patch P1 (GM_Polygon) the boundary
of which consists of exterior and interior rings. The exterior ring CC1
(GM_CompositeCurve) is an aggregation of C1, C2, C3 (GM_Curve), the interior ring
C4 is a simple GM_Curve.

=== 2.5 Dimensional Geometry Example

.2.5D Example

In the depicted example, the curve which constitutes the exterior boundary of a
GM_Polygon consists of an array of 3D control points. Note that the surface
interpolation must be "none", which means that the position of interior points is
not determined. The "planar" interpolation would only be acceptable if all points
were lying on a plane.
