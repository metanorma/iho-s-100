== Scope

The spatial requirements of S-100 are less comprehensive than the requirements of
<<ISO19107>> "Geographical Information - Spatial schema" which contains all the
information necessary for describing and manipulating the spatial characteristics
of geographical features and on which this Part is based. Hence this Part contains
only the subset of <<ISO19107>> classes required for S-100. This version only
contains geometry, if there is a future requirement for topology then this Part
will be extended to meet these requirements.

This Part specifies:

. A subset of <<ISO19107>> classes (clause 6) which is the minimum required to
support 0, 1, 2 and 2.5 dimensional Spatial Schemas. As such it is restricted to
specifying only data and does not include operations; and
. Additional constraints (omitted optional elements or constrained cardinalities)
which are imposed on these classes by this profile.
. Additional classes for certain kinds of curvilinear geometry. These additional
classes are based on specifications that are expected to be in the next edition of
<<ISO19107>>.
