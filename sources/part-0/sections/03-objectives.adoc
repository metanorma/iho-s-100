== Objectives of S-100

The objectives of S-100 are:

. To comply with the emerging ISO standards for geographic information being produced
by ISO TC 211;
. To provide support for a greater variety of marine or hydrographic-related digital
data, products and customers;
. To separate the data content from the encoding format, enabling format neutral
product specifications;
. To enable manageable flexibility that can accommodate change. The intention is that
product specifications will be allowed to evolve through extension without the need to
publish new versions of existing product specifications;
. To provide an ISO-conformant registry managed by the IHO containing registers such as
feature concept dictionaries and product feature catalogues that are flexible and
capable of managed expansion;
. To provide separate registers for different user communities.
