The elements for referencing spatial objects by use of
coordinates are described in five packages. All packages depend
on the package "Identified Objects", which describes the
mechanism of linking elements to external definitions.

It also assures that each element can be uniquely named to
identify it in a data set or software application. To facilitate
the work with class names, every package shall use a prefix for
its classes and data types. <<tab-6-1>> below shows the prefixes
for various packages:
