[[cls-13-4]]
== Purpose

This Part is provided to permit the normative expression and processing of
rules for S-100 based products. Possible usage examples include: portrayal
rules, product interoperability rules, rules for detecting navigational
hazards, data validation rules, etc.

The use of scripting removes ambiguity from rule expression, ensures
consistency among applications, and allows for rules to be modified or
extended via catalogue updates.
