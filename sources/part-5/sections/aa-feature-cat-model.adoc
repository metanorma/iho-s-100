== Feature Catalogue Model

This appendix presents the S-100 Feature Catalogue. <<fig-5-A-1>> is the S-100
Feature Catalogue modelled in UML and <<tab-5-A-1;to!tab-5-A-20>> illustrate the
structure of the Feature Catalogue in conformance to the model shown.

| Literal
| association
| The association end is an ordinary linkage. (In UML terms, the role type is "aggregationKind=ordinary" and the link in a diagram does not have a diamond)
| The object at this end may be participating in an ordinary association, an aggregation, or a composition

| Literal
| aggregation
| The association end is a UML aggregation. (In UML terms, the role type is "aggregationKind=aggregation" and the link in a diagram has an unfilled diamond at this association end)
| The object at this end is the "owner", "whole" or "container" in an aggregation association

| Literal
| composition
| The association end is a UML aggregation. (In UML terms, the role type is "aggregationKind=composition" and the link in a diagram has a filled diamond at this association end)
| The object at this end is the "owner", "whole" or "container" in an composition association
|===

NOTE: If one end of the association is "aggregation" or "composition", the other
end must be coded as "association".
