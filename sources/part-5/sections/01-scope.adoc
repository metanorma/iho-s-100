== Scope

This Part provides a standard framework for organizing and reporting the
classification of real world phenomena in a set of geographic data. It defines
the methodology for classification of the feature types and specifies how they
are organized in a Feature Catalogue and presented to the users of a set of
geographic data. This methodology is applicable to creating catalogues of feature
types in previously uncatalogued domains and to revising existing Feature
Catalogues to comply with standard practice. It applies to the cataloguing of
feature types that are represented in digital form. Its principles can be
extended to the cataloguing of other forms of geographic data.

A Feature Catalogue shall be defined for each Product Specification.

This Part is applicable to the definition of geographic features at the type
level but not applicable to the representation of individual instances of each
type.
